## Installation and running steps

First of all you will need two separated terminals to run the project, one to run the server and another to run the front end.

But before running you will need to install the dependencies:

Go to the project folder, then install what is needed for each folder.
For the server:

```
cd api-server/
yarn (or npm install)
```

Go back to project root folder, then go to the frontend folder:

```
cd frontend/
yarn (or npm install)
```

To run:

Launch first the server in one terminal, go to the server folder then:

```
  node server.js
```

Then launch the fronted in another terminal, go to the frontedn folder then:

```
  yarn start
```

This will open your browser and go to the fronted project  `http://localhost:3000`.
